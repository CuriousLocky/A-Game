# A-Game
//Edited 2019.04.01
A game probably will be made by a group of weird guys and a triton.
Due to the size of the team, everyone is doing everything(except Matchy does all the art).


Things decided: 
    core gameplay style: roguelike 2D shooter
    game engine: Game Maker Studio 2
    other traits: 
        multi-verse, 
        meta, 
        multiple endings, 
        game style change between worlds, variants:
            enemy:
                theme,
                overall number,
                range,
                firerate,
                damage per capita
            weapon:
                theme,
                range,
                firerate,
                explosion radius
            areana environment:
                obstacle number,
                (de)buff/(in)avaibility on certain weapon type,
                fraction,
                tba
            character:
                (de)buff/(in)avaibility on certain weapon type,
                special move,
                basic settings(health, speed, etc)
                tba
            special effect:
                zombilization (just pretend there is such a word),
                magicalization,
                mechanicalization
    
Things todo:
    Get familiar with the engine,
    Figure out the following designs:
        main story script,
        details of each world,
        all character designs

Things to decide later:
    game music,
    title,
    Everything else
    
We need new crews for:
    script,
    art,
    any other idea
